# CVE-2023-33105: Transient DOS in WLAN Host and Firmware

## Overview
This repository contains the exploit code for CVE-2023-33105, a vulnerability identified in Qualcomm devices. The exploit leverages authentication frames to perform a denial of service (DoS) attack on a target access point (AP) by sending a large number of open authentication frames with an invalid transaction sequence number.

- **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-33105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33105)
- **Qualcomm Security Bulletin**: [March 2024 Bulletin](https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/march-2024-bulletin.html)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- Airodump-ng
- A wireless network adapter capable of injection

## Files
- `config.py`: Configuration file for setting target MAC addresses and parameters.
- `exploit_v2.py`: Main exploit script.

## Configuration
Before running the exploit, update the `config.py` file with the target MAC addresses and other parameters.

```python
# config.py

# MAC address of the station (client)
sta_target = 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX'  # change this

# MAC address of the access point (AP)
ap_target = 'YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY'  # change this

# Number of frames to send
spray = 500

# Interval for checking if the BSSID is still up (in seconds)
check_interval = 60
```

## Usage
1. Ensure your wireless network adapter is in monitor mode.
2. Run the exploit script:

```bash
python exploit_v2.py
```

The script will send a large number of open authentication frames with invalid transaction sequence numbers to the target AP, causing a transient DoS.
